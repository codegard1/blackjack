# Chris's Blackjack

### Introduction
This project is an attempt to build a game of blackjack from scratch, as a way to practice implementing some of the web technologies I've been using at work. 

#### Technologies Used
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Office UI Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric)@2.34
* [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) 
* [node-shuffle](https://github.com/codegard1/node-shuffle) (forked)

#### Project Status as of 9/6/2017
* Endgame conditions are now handled more or less as expected
* Game options are now sequestered in a panel  
* Extraneous UI elements have been hidden from the game table by default
* Player actions are displayed in callouts beneath each player deck
* Many small updates to the styles used in Player Containers 

#### Wish List
* Use [CSS Card Tricks](https://designshack.net/articles/css/css-card-tricks/) to style cards (6/13/17)
* Use CSS transitions to flip / move cards (6/13/17)
* Convert entire project to TypeScript (9/6/2017) 
* Show recommended moves to teach the human player good strategy (9/6/2017)
* Implement a basic AI for the non-human player
