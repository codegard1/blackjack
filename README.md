# Chris's Blackjack

### Introduction
This project is an attempt to build a game of blackjack from scratch, as a way to practice implementing some of the web technologies I've been using at work. 

#### Technologies Used
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Office UI Fabric](https://dev.office.com/fabric)@2.34
* [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) 
* [node-shuffle](https://github.com/codegard1/node-shuffle) (forked)

#### Project Status as of 7/24/2017
* Visual logic is basically done, but will improve over time
* Game features implemented: deck, players, hands, betting
* All control panel buttons work as expected
* Selecting / deselecting cards works as expected
* Game correctly calculates the value of each hand
* Masonry component now renders at the correct width

#### Wish List
* Use [CSS Card Tricks](https://designshack.net/articles/css/css-card-tricks/) to style cards (6/13/17)
* Use CSS transitions to flip / move cards (6/13/17)
* Implement JSDoc across the board (6/13/17)
